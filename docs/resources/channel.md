# slack_channel (Resource)

This resource manages public and private Slack channels.


## Example Usage

### Basic channel

```hcl
resource "slack_channel" "devops" {
  name       = "devops-alerts"
  is_private = false
  topic      = "Deployments and alerts"
  purpose    = "Channel for DevOps monitoring"
}
```

### Channel with members

```hcl
data "slack_user" "alice" {
  email = "alice@example.com"
}

data "slack_user" "bob" {
  email = "bob@example.com"
}

resource "slack_channel" "sre" {
  name       = "sre-team"
  is_private = true

  members = [
    data.slack_user.alice.id,
    data.slack_user.bob.id,
  ]

  topic   = "SRE team channel"
  purpose = "Site Reliability Engineering discussions"
}
```

### Strict member tracking

By default, Terraform only manages the members you declare and ignores manually added users. If you want Terraform to detect drift when users are manually added, use `strict_members`:

```hcl
resource "slack_channel" "important" {
  name           = "important-announcements"
  strict_members = true  # Terraform will show drift if users are manually added
  
  members = [
    data.slack_user.admin.id,
  ]
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String)

### Optional

- `is_private` (Boolean) Whether the channel is private (true) or public (false). Default: `false`.
- `members` (Set of String) List of user IDs to add to the channel.
- `strict_members` (Boolean) If `true`, Terraform will detect drift when users are manually added to the channel. If `false` (default), Terraform only manages the declared members and ignores manually added users. Default: `false`.
- `purpose` (String) Purpose (description) of the channel.
- `topic` (String) Topic shown at the top of the channel.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.


## Import

```hcl
terraform import slack_channel.example C12345678
```

## Notes

- **Existing channels**: If a channel with the same name already exists (including archived), it will be reused instead of creating a new one.
- **Member management**: 
  - By default (`strict_members = false`), Terraform only manages the members you declare. Manually added users are ignored.
  - With `strict_members = true`, Terraform will show drift when users are manually added or removed.
  - ⚠️ **Important**: The Slack API does NOT allow removing users from channels. Terraform can only add members, not remove them.
- **Removal limitation**: When you remove a user from the `members` list, Terraform will show a warning but cannot actually remove them from Slack. Users must be removed manually in the Slack UI.
- `topic` and `purpose` are optional but useful for channel documentation.
