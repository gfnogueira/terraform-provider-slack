# Slack Provider

The `slack` provider allows you to interact with the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) using Terraform.

You can use it to manage:
- Public and private channels
- Users and user groups
- Channel membership and metadata

> ⚠️ **Note**: You need a valid Slack Bot Token (`xoxb-...`) with the necessary scopes to use this provider.

---

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "slack" {
  token = var.slack_token
}

data "slack_channel" "general" {
  name = "general"
}

resource "slack_channel" "alerts" {
  name        = "alerts"
  is_private  = true
  topic       = "Monitoring alerts"
  purpose     = "Infrastructure team"
}
```

---

## Authentication

This provider requires a **Slack Bot Token** (`xoxb-...`) which must have permission to read and manage channels, users, and other workspace elements.

You can obtain a token by creating a Slack App at:  
https://api.slack.com/apps

Then assign the necessary scopes (like `channels:read`, `users:read`, etc) and install the app in your workspace.

We recommend setting the token via environment variable:

```bash
export SLACK_TOKEN="xoxb-..."
```

And referencing it in Terraform like this:

```hcl
provider "slack" {
  token = var.slack_token
}
```
