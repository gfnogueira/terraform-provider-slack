A Terraform provider to manage Slack channels, users, user groups, and more — directly from your infrastructure code.

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.3.0
- Go >= 1.22 (only for local development)

---

## 📦 Installation

To use this provider, add the following to your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    slack = {

      version = "0.1.5"
    }
  }
}
```

Then run:

## 🔐 Authentication

The provider uses a Slack bot token (with appropriate scopes).  
Add the token to your environment:

```bash
